Crop prediction is essential for optimizing agricultural production, enhancing food security, and promoting sustainability. Traditional methods often fall short in handling the growing complexity and volume of agricultural data. 
Our robust crop yield prediction model integrates meteorological, environmental, economic, and crop-specific data using advanced data mining and machine learning techniques. 
By leveraging decision tree regressors, the model captures non-linear relationships among variables, enabling accurate and rapid forecasting tailored to local conditions, crop types, and climate variability. 
This data-driven approach improves yield forecasting accuracy, supports sustainable practices, and enhances agricultural resilience, ultimately fostering a more productive and sustainable ecosystem.
